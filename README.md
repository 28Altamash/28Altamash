PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE 
 • Gurugram Police Cyber Security Intern January 2021 - June 2021
During my tenure as a Cybersecurity Intern at Gurugram Police in Noida, India, I honed my 
expertise in cyber forensics tools, acquired proficiency in reconnaissance and digital 
footprinting techniques, and actively contributed to darknet-related cases under the 
guidance of senior cyber police mentors. This experience equipped me with a versatile skill 
set and an in-depth understanding of cybercrime investigations. Additionally, I proactively 
engaged in continuous learning to stay abreast of evolving threats in the cybersecurity 
landscape. My internship was a transformative experience that solidified my passion for 
cybersecurity and prepared me to tackle future challenges in the field.

PROJECT EXPERIENCE 

• Capstone Project: Drowsiness Detection System for the Trucking Industry
During my final semester in my Postgraduate Certificate program in Artificial Intelligence and 
Data Science, I spearheaded a transformative capstone project. I programmed and trained a 
Python-based machine learning model for detecting drowsy drivers in the trucking industry, 
equipped with a manager-side alarm system to preempt accidents. This vital safety feature 
monitored driver behaviors like blinking frequency and eye closure duration. Upon detecting 
drowsiness, it issued audible alerts and vibrations, encouraging immediate corrective action 
and even generated graphical sleep pattern data for analysis. This project underscored the 
practical application of AI and data science in real-world safety challenges, reinforcing my 
commitment to technology-driven innovation.

• Cyber Security Semester Project: RSA Encryption Tool
The RSA Encryption Tool, written in Rust for my first-semester assignment in advanced 
scripting as part of my second Postgraduate Certificate in Cybersecurity, serves as a versatile 
program for RSA encryption and decryption tasks. It offers three primary functions: key pair 
generation, file encryption, and file decryption. The choice of utilizing the "OpenSSL" library 
rather than a specific RSA implementation enhances the program's versatility, providing 
access to a broader array of cryptographic capabilities. OpenSSL's well-established 
reputation, extensive user base, and rapid response to security concerns make it a reliable 
choice for cryptographic operations. The tool depends on external libraries, namely openssl 
for RSA operations and clap for command-line argument parsing. Key pair generation saves 
public and private keys separately as public_key.pem and private_key.pemfiles, while 
encryption and decryption employ the RSA algorithm with PKCS1 padding. The main function 
presents a user menu for these operations, encapsulating a comprehensive package for RSA 
encryption in Rust.
