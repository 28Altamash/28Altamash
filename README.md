 PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE  

 

     •    Gurugram Police Cyber Security Intern                                 January 2021 - June 2021 

During my tenure as a Cybersecurity Intern at Gurugram Police in Noida, India, I honed my expertise in cyber forensics tools, acquired proficiency in reconnaissance and digital footprinting techniques, and actively contributed to darknet-related cases under the guidance of senior cyber police mentors. This experience equipped me with a versatile skill set and an in-depth understanding of cybercrime investigations. Additionally, I proactively engaged in continuous learning to stay abreast of evolving threats in the cybersecurity landscape. My internship was a transformative experience that solidified my passion for cybersecurity and prepared me to tackle future challenges in the field. 

 

 

 

 

 

 

    Network Engineer L3					                        June 2021 - July 2022 

Cisco India, Bangalore 

Project: Saudi Aramco Smart city 

 

As a Network Engineer at Cisco working on the Saudi Aramco project, I was tasked with a wide range of responsibilities aimed at ensuring robust network performance and security. My core duties included building and configuring network setups, maintaining and optimizing network connections, and performing diligent IP address auditing. I played a pivotal role in establishing the networking environment through strategic system configuration and guiding the system installation process. 

My job required a keen attention to detail to define, document, and enforce network system standards that align with organizational objectives. I was responsible for maximizing network performance by conducting thorough troubleshooting for any network problems or outages, as well as by planning and executing necessary upgrades. 

An integral part of my role involved configuring routers, updating data servers, and network equipment to support the seamless operation of the network infrastructure. I collaborated closely with network architects to optimize the network, ensuring efficient and effective communication and data transfer across the system. 

To maintain a secure network system, I established and enforced robust security policies, and I was vigilant in defining and monitoring access to safeguard against unauthorized use. Keeping abreast of the latest industry developments was also part of my job description, requiring me to update my knowledge through educational opportunities, professional publications, and participation in relevant professional organizations. 

 Lastly, my contributions were instrumental in achieving the information systems and organizational mission by delivering on related outcomes as required, thereby supporting the overarching goals of the Saudi Aramco project. 

 

    Children's Aid Society of Algoma			September 2023 – December 2023  

In my current capstone experience as part of my second-semester Postgraduate Certificate in Cybersecurity, I am collaborating with the Children's Aid Society of Algoma. My team and I are tasked with a comprehensive cybersecurity assignment that includes penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and a critical evaluation known as the "Antivirus Weakness Study" and "Detonation of Ransomware on Test Network." Our primary goal is to scrutinize the organization's antivirus system, SentinelOne, identifying and addressing any weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Through this hands-on experience, I am not only applying my cybersecurity knowledge but also contributing to enhancing the security posture of the Children's Aid Society of Algoma, emphasizing the vital role of cybersecurity in safeguarding organizations and their data. 

 

PROJECT EXPERIENCE  

    Capstone Project: Drowsiness Detection System for the Trucking Industry 

During my final semester in my Postgraduate Certificate program in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, I spearheaded a transformative capstone project. I programmed and trained a Python-based machine learning model for detecting drowsy drivers in the trucking industry, equipped with a manager-side alarm system to preempt accidents. This vital safety feature monitored driver behaviors like blinking frequency and eye closure duration. Upon detecting drowsiness, it issued audible alerts and vibrations, encouraging immediate corrective action and even generated graphical sleep pattern data for analysis. This project underscored the practical application of AI and data science in real-world safety challenges, reinforcing my commitment to technology-driven innovation. 

    Cyber Security Semester Project: RSA Encryption Tool 

The RSA Encryption Tool, written in Rust for my first-semester assignment in advanced scripting as part of my second Postgraduate Certificate in Cybersecurity, serves as a versatile program for RSA encryption and decryption tasks. It offers three primary functions: key pair generation, file encryption, and file decryption. The choice of utilizing the "OpenSSL" library rather than a specific RSA implementation enhances the program's versatility, providing access to a broader array of cryptographic capabilities. OpenSSL's well-established reputation, extensive user base, and rapid response to security concerns make it a reliable choice for cryptographic operations. The tool depends on external libraries, namely openssl for RSA operations and clap for command-line argument parsing. Key pair generation saves public and private keys separately as public_key.pem and private_key.pem files, while encryption and decryption employ the RSA algorithm with PKCS1 padding. The main function presents a user menu for these operations, encapsulating a comprehensive package for RSA encryption in Rust.
